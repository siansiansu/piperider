# Git Versioning

Piperider project is by design to be source-controlled in a git repository. The generated `.piperider/.gitignore` is our recommended way to ignore files/folder in git. The current settings are

```text
**.log
__pycache__/
logs/
outputs/
reports/
comparisons/
credentials.yml
.unsend_events.json
```
